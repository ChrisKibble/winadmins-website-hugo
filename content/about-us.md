WinAdmins is a community of nearly 4,000 people who are (have we stressed this enough) “loosely organized”. That said, there are a number of key players in the organization who contribute to the collective in one way or another.

# Organizers and Administrators

The organizers and administrators are responsible for the day to day work of WinAdmins. We work to ensure that technologies are in place for you to connect, communicate, help one another, and socialize.
